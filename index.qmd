## Hello!

<hr class="custom-line">

My name is Maxwell, and I created this personal website using Quarto to share a little bit about who I am and some of the projects I've worked on throughout my academic and professional experiences. I am a 2nd-year master's student in Environmental Science and Management at the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) and received a B.S. in Environmental Management & Protection from Cal Poly, SLO in June 2023. Specializing in Conservation Planning with an emphasis in GIS and geospatial analysis at the Bren School, I hope to develop data-driven solutions to todayâ€™s critical environmental problems. I have a strong interest in data analysis, geospatial analysis, and GIS and am excited to apply these skills in the field of natural resource management and conservation planning.
