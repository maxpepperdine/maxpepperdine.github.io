## Background

With an ever growing human population, marine aquaculture has the potential to play a significant role global food supply, and is a more sustainable option than land-based meat production (Hall et al., 2011). A study that mapped the global potential for marine aquaculture based on multiple constraints (e.g., ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, bottom depth) found that global seafood demand could be met using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area (Gentry et al., 2017).

This analysis aims to determine which Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the West Coast of the US are best suited to develop marine aquaculture for several species of oysters and Pacific littleneck clams (*Leukoma staminea*),two of the most common species farmed in marine aquaculture on the West Coast. Suitable growing locations were determined based on range of suitable sea surface temperature (SST) and depth values for each species listed below. Oyster conditions were provided in the assignment description, and suitable temperatures and depths for the littleneck clam were selected based on Shaw (1986) and Harbo (1997). Suitable growing areas for oysters were found first, and then the workflow was made generalizable by transforming into a function that could be used to find suitable growing areas for any marine aquaculture species on the West Coast based on ocean depth and SST.

Suitable growing conditions for oysters:

-   `sea surface temperature`: 11-30°C
-   `depth`: 0-70 meters below sea level

Suitable growing conditions for the Pacific littleneck clam:

-   `sea surface temperature`: 0-25°C
-   `depth`: 0-46 meters below sea level

## Data description

#### Sea surface temperature (SST)

Annual sea surface temperature (SST) from the years 2008 to 2012 were used to characterize the average SST within the region. This data was originally generated from [NOAA’s 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly v3.1.](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php)

Data files:

-   `average_annual_sst_2008.tif`
-   `average_annual_sst_2009.tif`
-   `average_annual_sst_2010.tif`
-   `average_annual_sst_2011.tif`
-   `average_annual_sst_2012.tif`

#### Bathyemtry

Bathymetric data was sourced from [General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/#area) to characterize the depth of the ocean (m below sea level).

Data file: `depth.tif`

#### Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)

Maritime boundaries were designated using Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) off of the west coast of US from [Marine Regions](https://www.marineregions.org/eez.php).

Data file: `wc_regions_clean.shp`

#### U.S. states & territories 

Boundaries for all U.S. states and territories, included for context in the maps, were sourced from [NOAA's national GIS program](https://www.weather.gov/gis/USStates).

Data file: `s_05mr24.shp`

## Analysis

*Pseudo code/outline:*

1.  Prepare data. Load all necessary data, combine the SST data into a raster stack, and make sure they're all in the same CRS. If not, transform everything to WGS 84 (`EPSG:4326`).

2.  Process data. Find the mean SST from 2008-2012, convert it from Kelvin to Celsius, resample the bathymetry raster to match the resolution, extent, and position of the SST raster, and crop the depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster.

3.  Find suitable locations. Determine which locations meet the suitable growing conditions for oysters only before expanding the workflow to other species. To do this, we first need to reclassify the bathymetry and SST rasters to either `NA` (unsuitable), or 1 (suitable). These rasters were then multiplied by each other to isolate areas that meet suitable conditions for both depth and SST. 

4. Determine the most suitable EEZ. Calculate the amount of suitable area for each EEZ region to rank zones by priority. To do this, rasterize the EEZ shapefile, mask it to the suitable locations, calculate the area of each cell in the raster, and sum the area of suitable locations in each EEZ. Lastly, join the area data back to the EEZ shapefile and make some visualizations.

5. Create a reproducible workflow for other species. After finding locations with suitable growing conditions for oysters, this workflow was transformed into a function that could isolate suitable growing conditions for any marine aquaculture species on the West Coast based on ocean depth and SST. The function has the following characteristics:

-   **arguments**:
    -   minimum and maximum sea surface temperature
    -   minimum and maximum depth
    -   species name
-   **outputs**:
    -   map of EEZ regions colored by amount of suitable area
    
6. Test the function for the Pacific littleneck clam! The function was tested for the Pacific littleneck clam using the species-specific growing conditions described above.

#### Load data

We want to load the SST data as a raster stack to make it easier to generate a mean SST raster for the years 2008-2012.

# none are in the same CRS; transform all to WGS 84
bathy <- project(bathy,

sst_stack <- project(sst_stack,

  print("Carry on! All datasets are now in the same CRS") 
} else {
  warning("STOP! Datasets are not in the same CRS")
}
```

#### Process data

To prepare the data for the growing suitability analysis, we found the mean SST from 2008-2012, converted it from Kelvin to Celsius, resampled the bathymetry raster to match the resolution, extent, and position of the SST raster using the nearest neighbor method, and cropped the depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# find the mean SST from 2008-2012
# create a single raster of average SST
sst_mean <- mean(sst_stack)
# plot(sst_mean) # QC to make sure this created one raster


# convert average SST from Kelvin to Celsius
# subtract 273.15 from each grid cell in the raster
sst_mean_celsius <- sst_mean - 273.15
# plot(sst_mean_celsius) # QC to make sure this worked


# resample the bathy raster 
# match the resolution, extent, and position of the SST raster
bathy_resample <- resample(bathy, 
                           sst_mean_celsius, 
                           method = "near")


# crop & mask the depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster 
bathy_crop <- crop(bathy_resample, 
                   sst_mean_celsius, 
                   mask = TRUE)
```

#### Find suitable locations for oysters

Suitable growing conditions for oysters are defined as follows:

-   `sea surface temperature`: 11-30°C
-   `depth`: 0-70 meters below sea level

To find suitable locations for oysters, we reclassified the SST and depth data into locations that meet the suitable growing conditions for oysters. Suitable areas we defined as 1, and unsuitable areas were assigned `NA` values. We then used map algebra to multiply the reclassified rasters together to find locations that meet the suitable growing conditions for both depth and SST. If either of these environmental variables' suitable conditions were not met, the location was assigned a value of NA and considered unsuitable. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# define SST reclassification matrix
rcl_sst <- matrix(c(-Inf, 11, NA, 
                    11, 30, 1, 
                    30, Inf, NA), 
                  ncol = 3, 
                  byrow = TRUE)
# define depth reclassification matrix
rcl_depth <- matrix(c(-Inf, -70, NA, 
                      -70, 0, 1, 
                      0, Inf, NA), 
                    ncol = 3, 
                    byrow = TRUE)

# reclassify SST and depth data into locations that are suitable for oysters
sst_reclass <- classify(sst_mean_celsius, 
                        rcl_sst)
bathy_reclass <- classify(bathy_crop, 
                          rcl_depth)



# find locations that meet the suitable growing conditions for oysters
# values of 1 indicate suitable locations for both depth and SST!
oyster_suitable <-  sst_reclass * bathy_reclass
# plot(oyster_suitable)
```

#### Determine the most suitable EEZ

To determine the most suitable EEZ for oysters, we calculated the total area of suitable growing locations in each EEZ region. We first rasterized the EEZ shapefile to mask it to the suitable locations for oysters. Then, we calculated the area of each cell in the raster using the `terra::cellSize()` function and summed the area of suitable locations in each EEZ with `terra::zonal()`. Lastly, we joined the area data back to the EEZ shapefile by `rgn` and calculated the percent of each EEZs total area that has suitable growing areas for oysters.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# rasterize the EEZ shapefile
wc_eez_rast <- rasterize(wc_eez, 
                         oyster_suitable, 
                         field = "rgn")
# plot(wc_eez_rast) # QC

# crop & mask it to the suitable locations for oysters
wc_eez_suitable <- crop(wc_eez_rast, 
                        oyster_suitable, 
                        mask = TRUE)

# find the area covered by each cell in the masked EEZ raster
cell_area <- cellSize(wc_eez_suitable, 
                      unit = "km")

# calculate the area of suitable locations for oysters in each EEZ
suitable_area <- zonal(cell_area, 
                       wc_eez_suitable, # define the zones to calc area in 
                       fun = "sum", 
                       na.rm = TRUE)

# join the area data back to the EEZ shapefile
wc_eez_joined <- left_join(wc_eez, suitable_area, 
                           by = "rgn") %>% 
  rename(suitable_area_km2 = area) %>% 
  select(rgn, rgn_key, area_km2, suitable_area_km2) %>% 
  mutate(percent_suitable = suitable_area_km2 / area_km2 * 100)
```

#### Visualize the results

To visualize the results, we made two figures: (1) a map of EEZ regions colored by the amount of suitable area (km^2) for oysters; (2) two bar plots to show the total suitable area (km^2) and the percent of each EEZs total area that has suitable growing areas for oysters.

## Make workflow generalizable

## Reflection

Looking at Figure 4, we can see that the central California EEZ (CA-C) has the greatest area of suitable growing locations for oysters based on SST and depth, and the Washington EEZ has the greatest percentage of suitable growing locations compared to the EEZs total area. Looking at Figure 5, we can see that the Washington EEZ has both the greatest area of suitable growing locations and the greatest percentage of suitable growing locations for the Pacific littleneck clam. 

As the human population continues to grow, the demand for seafood is expected to increase. Marine aquaculture has the potential to play a significant role in meeting this demand, and is a more sustainable option than land-based meat production. This analysis aimed to determine which Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the West Coast of the US are best suited to develop marine aquaculture for several species of oysters and the Pacific littleneck clam. We only considered two species and two variables driving suitable growing conditions in this analysis, but the workflow can be easily adapted to other species and additional predictor variables to create more robust suitability modeling.
