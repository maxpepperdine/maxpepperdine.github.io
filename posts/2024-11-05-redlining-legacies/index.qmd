## Background

Legacies of historical injustices are often reflected in present-day environmental injustices. One example of this is racial segregation in the United States, in which a long history of these injustices are still visible today. As part of the New Deal in the 1930's, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) classified neighborhoods based on their perceived safety or risk for mortgage lending (hereby refered to as 'HOLC grade'). Thy used this ranking system (HOLC grades of A, B, C, D) to block access to loans for home ownership, delineating maps to indicate where mortgages and loans should not be invested. This practice, colloquially known as "redlining," disproportionately affected communities of color and has had lasting impacts on the socio-economic and environmental conditions of these neighborhoods that are still evident today.

This analysis aims to explore the legacy of redlining in Los Angeles County by examining the distribution of environmental and biodiversity observations within each HOLC grade. The analysis will be divided into two parts:

1.  **Legacy of redlining in current environmental (in)justice:** This section will explore the relationship between HOLC grades and three environmental justice (EJ) screen variables in Los Angeles County: % low income, percentile for PM 2.5, and percentile for low life expectancy. The analysis will examine how the current conditions of these variables differ with the four HOLC grades.

2.  **Legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations:** This section will examine the distribution of bird observations from 2022 within each HOLC grade in Los Angeles County to explore how the distribution of biodiversity observations has been influenced by historical redlining practices.

#### Determine the % of current census block groups within each HOLC grade

*Pseudocode outline:*

1.  Check if the EJ screen and HOLC redlining data are in the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS) using `st_crs()`. If they are not in the same CRS, reproject one of the datasets to match the other.

2.  Join the HOLC redlining data to the EJ screen data. In this step, I used a spatial join with `st_join()` because this joins based on geometries that intersect by default. `st_join()` also performs a left join by default, so this will keep all the EJ screen data which is already at the block group level and add the HOLC grade to each observation.

3.  Calculate the % census blocks groups within in HOLC grade (A, B, C, D). Group the data by HOLC grade using `group_by()` and then calculate the % of block groups in each grade. I used the `n()` function to count the number of block groups in each grade, and then calculated the % of block groups in each grade by dividing the count number by the sum of blocks counted.

4.  Clean up the data and show the results in a table (Table 1 below).

###### QC #2: Are the EJ screen and redlining data in the same CRS?

} else {
  warning("The EJ screen and HOLC redlining data are NOT in the same CRS")

  rename("HOLC Grade" = grade) %>% # make the column names cleaner

# change the # of decimals in the % column to 2

###### Overview of analysis & variables

-   *Analysis goal:*
    -   This analysis aims to explore the relationship between the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades and three EJ Screen variables in Los Angeles County. To examine how the current conditions of these variables in census block groups differ with the four HOLC grades, I calculated the mean of each variable within each HOLC grade. Figure 2 below shows the results of this analysis.
-   *Variables of interest:*
    -   **% low income (`LOWINCPCT`)**: Taken from the EPA EJ Screen documentation: "The percent of a block group's population in households where the household income is less than or equal to twice the federal 'poverty level.'"
    -   **Percentile for PM 2.5 (`P_PM25`)**: Taken from the EPA EJ Screen documentation: "EJScreen presents PM2.5 concentrations using percentile rank, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest)."
    -   **Percentile for low life expectancy (`P_LIFEEXPPCT`)**: Taken from the EPA EJ Screen documentation: EJScreen presents life expectancy using percentile rank, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest) low life expectancy. A higher percentile indicates a lower life expectancy.

###### Data wrangling

*Steps/Pseudocode outline:*

1.  Filter the EJ Screen data to create three new data frames that contain the EJ Screen variables of interest in LA County: % low income (`LOWINCPCT`), percentile for PM 2.5 (`P_PM25`), and percentile for low life expectancy (`P_LIFEEXPPCT`)

2.  With each of the three variables created, join the EJ Screen data to the HOLC redlining data. In this step, I again used a spatial join with `st_join()` because this joins based on geometries that intersect by default. `st_join()` also performs a left join by default, so this will keep all the EJ Screen data and add the HOLC grade to each observation.

3.  Calculate the mean of each variable for each HOLC grade. This is done by grouping the data by HOLC grade using `group_by()` and then calculating the mean of the variable of interest. I used the `na.rm = TRUE` argument in the `mean()` function to remove any NA values in the data.

4.  Make a set of figures to show the results, and then combine them into one with the `patchwork` package.

```{r}

  select(ID, P_PM25) # percentile for PM 2.5

ej_screen_life_exp <- ej_screen_la %>%
  select(ID, P_LIFEEXPPCT) # percentile for low life expectancy


## join the EJ screen data to the HOLC redlining data for each variable
ej_screen_redlining_low_income <- st_join(ej_screen_low_income, holc_redlining)

ej_screen_redlining_pm25 <- st_join(ej_screen_pm25, holc_redlining)

```

#### Interpretation of Results

Looking at the results of the analysis shown in Figure 2 above, it is clear that areas with **lower HOLC grades** (i.e., D) have **higher % low income, higher percentiles for particulate matter 2.5, and higher percentiles for low life expectancy**. This suggests that the legacy of redlining has had long lasting impacts on the socio-economic and environmental conditions of these neighborhoods, and that these present day environmental injustices reflect patterns of historical injustice. Given that that this analysis only explored 3 environmental and demographic variables, future research could expand on this analysis by examining additional information offered on EJ screen and exploring their conditions within different HOLC grades.

## Part 2: Legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations

#### Background

A recent study by Ellis-Soto et al. (2023) found that historical redlining has influenced our observations of biodiversity along with the socio-economic and environmental conditions of communities. Looking across 195 US cities, they found that redlined neighborhoods remain the most under sampled areas for biodiversity. One reason that makes this disparity concerning is that conservation decisions and management actions are often made based on available observation data. This can lead to biased selection of locations for conservation, inequitable distribution of the many benefits that result from being adjacent or close to conservation projects, and incomplete representations of biodiversity.

To explore this further, this analysis will examine the distribution of bird observations from 2022 within each HOLC grade in Los Angeles County using publicly accessible data from Nelson et al. (2023) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

#### Load data

```{r, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true

# GBIF birds data
birds <- st_read(here("posts/2024-11-05-redlining-legacies/data/gbif-birds-LA/gbif-birds-LA.shp"))

# filter to only include data from 2022 bc the assignment
# asks to analyze observations from 2022
birds <- birds %>% 
  filter(year == 2022)
```

#### QC #4: Are the GBIF birds data and redlining data in the same CRS?

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# make sure the CRS of the GBIF birds data and HOLC redlining are the same
if(st_crs(birds) == st_crs(holc_redlining)) {
  print("The GBIF birds data and HOLC redlining data are in the same CRS")
} else {
  warning("The GBIF birds data and HOLC redlining data are NOT in the same CRS")
}
```

if(all(birds$year == 2022)) {
  print("The GBIF birds data only includes observations from 2022")
} else {
  warning("Stop! The GBIF birds data includes observations from other years")
}
```

#### Data wrangling

*Steps/Pseudocode outline:*

1.  Join the GBIF birds data with observations from 2022 to the HOLC redlining data. In this step, I again used a spatial join with `st_join()` because this joins based on geometries that intersect by default. `st_join()` also performs a left join by default, so this will keep all the GBIF birds data and add the HOLC grade to each observation.

2.  Calculate the percent of observations within each HOLC grade. This is done by grouping the data by HOLC grade using `group_by()` and then calculating the percent of observations in each grade. I used the `n()` function to count the number of observations in each grade and then calculated the percent of observations in each grade by dividing this number by the sum of observations.

3.  Make a figure to show the results.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# join the HOLC redlining data to the GBIF birds data
birds_redlining <- st_join(birds, holc_redlining)

# calculate the % of observations within each HOLC grade
birds_redlining_pct <- birds_redlining %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>% # count the number of observations in each grade
  mutate(pct_grade = n / sum(n) * 100) # add new column of % obsvs. in each grade

# change NA value in the HOLC Grade column to "None"; same method as above
birds_redlining_pct$grade <- 
  ifelse(is.na(birds_redlining_pct$grade), "None", 
         birds_redlining_pct$grade)

# change the # of decimals in the % column to 2
birds_redlining_pct$pct_grade <- 
  round(birds_redlining_pct$pct_grade, 2)

# make a new object without the None observations 
birds_redlining_pct_no_none <- birds_redlining_pct %>% 
  filter(grade != "None")
```

#### Interpretation of Results

Ellis-Soto et al. (2023) found that redlining has shaped our observations and distribution of biodiveristy as well as the socio-economic and environmental conditions of communities. They showed that "historically redlined neigborhoods remain the most under sampled urban areas for bird biodiversity today." While there isn't a clear difference in the % of bird observations between HOLC grades, Figure 1(A) makes it clear that redlined neighborhoods are still under sampled for bird biodiversity. This aligns with the findings of Ellis-Soto et al. (2023) and suggests that the legacy of redlining has had lasting impacts on the distribution of biodiversity observations in Los Angeles County.
