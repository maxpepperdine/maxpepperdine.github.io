## About me

Hi there! I'm Maxwell Pepperdine (no affiliation to the university) and I'm a current master's student in Environmental Science and Management at the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara. Specializing in Conservation Planning with an emphasis in GIS and geospatial analysis, I hope to develop data-driven solutions to todayâ€™s critical environmental problems. I have a strong interest in data analysis, geospatial analysis, and GIS and am excited to apply these skills in the field of natural resource management and conservation planning.

I graduated summa cum laude from California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo in June of 2023 with a B.S. in Environmental Management and Protection and double minors in Biology & Sustainable Environments. Growing up in Santa Cruz, CA, I was fortunate to be surrounded by incredible ocean and redwood ecosystems which fostered my admiration and affinity for the natural environment at an early age. Outside of work and school, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, playing disc golf, ocean photography and spending time with friends and family.
